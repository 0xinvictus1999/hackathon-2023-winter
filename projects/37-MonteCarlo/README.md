## 基本资料

项目名称：蒙特卡洛 Monte Carlo

项目立项日期 (哪年哪月)：2023 年 9 月

## 项目整体简介

### Introduction
Monte Carlo is a decentralized AIGC computing power protocol. 
We build an open platform based on the Monte Carlo protocol and blockchain, where anyone can pay in cryptocurrency to generate their own AIGC content.
The content provided by AIGC can be utilized to mint NFTs and allowing the selection of high-quality items.
The worker providers will get royalties from the generation fee.

### Background
Many builders are trying adopting on-chain-analytics + LLM,  NFT + AIGC or blockchain-based games + AI agent. 
But no practical Web3-native AI infra to support them yet

### Insights
Web3-native AI infrastructure holds significant potential in revolutionizing the way artificial intelligence operates and interacts. The primary benefits are centered around composability - with Web3, different AI tools can be seamlessly combined for better functionality, creating a more cohesive and multi-dimensional system. Also, it offers better verifiability, ensuring the transparency and reliability of AI operations. Importantly, Web3-native AI respects authentic rights of invention, providing the option to share benefits from any derivable concepts, leading to a fairer and more inclusive creation landscape. It also promises cost-efficiency and could be pivotal in aiding AI startups, particularly by providing easy access to GPU computing powers. Harnessing the power of Web3 tokenomics, such infrastructure could incentivize global GPU resource contributions, building a vibrant, worldwide community. Additionally, by making high-end AI technology more accessible and understandable for the broader public, it could help in popularizing these advanced concepts, thereby fostering an environment of innovation and inclusivity.
