# Intro

Svarog aims to simplify the developer experience when it comes to testing and developing dApps or pallets for Substrate-based networks by allowing developers to run, maintain, and query the network.

Svarog is an agnostic developer framework that allows developers to run multiple different instances of Substrate-based networks.
